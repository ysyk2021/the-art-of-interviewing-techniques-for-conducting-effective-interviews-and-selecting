In this chapter, we will explore various techniques and strategies to build rapport with candidates during the interview process. Building rapport is essential as it establishes a positive and comfortable environment, allowing candidates to showcase their true abilities and enabling interviewers to gain deeper insights into their qualifications. By employing the techniques outlined in this chapter, you can create meaningful connections with candidates and conduct more effective interviews.

## 1\. Create a Welcoming Atmosphere

To establish rapport from the beginning, create a warm and welcoming atmosphere for candidates. Greet them with a friendly smile and a firm handshake (if applicable). Offer them a comfortable seat and ensure that the interview setting is inviting and professional. By creating a positive first impression, candidates will feel at ease and be more open to building rapport throughout the interview.

## 2\. Active Listening

Active listening is a crucial technique for building rapport. Pay close attention to what candidates are saying and show genuine interest in their responses. Maintain good eye contact and nod or provide affirmations to convey your engagement. Encourage candidates to elaborate on their answers by using follow-up questions or prompts. When candidates feel heard and understood, they are more likely to feel connected and comfortable during the interview.

## 3\. Establish Common Ground

Finding common ground with candidates can help establish a connection and build rapport. Look for shared experiences, interests, or backgrounds that you can discuss briefly at the beginning of the interview. This can be related to their educational background, previous work experience, or hobbies. However, avoid discussing topics that may be too personal or controversial. Establishing common ground shows candidates that you value their individuality and creates a sense of shared understanding.

## 4\. Use Open-Ended Questions

Using open-ended questions encourages candidates to provide detailed responses, fostering a deeper conversation and building rapport. Instead of asking questions that can be answered with a simple "yes" or "no," ask questions that require candidates to reflect and provide insightful responses. This allows candidates to share their thoughts, experiences, and perspectives more openly, leading to a more engaging and rapport-building interview.

## 5\. Show Empathy

Demonstrating empathy is an essential technique for building rapport and fostering a positive interview experience. Put yourself in the candidate's shoes and show understanding for their experiences, challenges, and achievements. Acknowledge their efforts and accomplishments throughout the interview. By showing empathy, you create a supportive environment where candidates feel valued and respected.

## 6\. Tailor Your Approach

Each candidate is unique, so it is important to adapt your approach to suit their individual personalities and communication styles. Some candidates may be more reserved, while others may be more outgoing. Adjust your tone and style accordingly to make candidates feel comfortable. Pay attention to non-verbal cues such as body language and adjust the interview style accordingly. Adapting to each candidate's preferences helps establish rapport and facilitates better communication.

## 7\. Share Information About the Company

Building rapport also involves sharing information about the company and the role. Provide candidates with a clear understanding of the organization's values, mission, and culture. Explain the job responsibilities, growth opportunities, and any other relevant information that can help candidates make an informed decision. Sharing transparent and comprehensive information demonstrates your commitment to their success and fosters trust and rapport.

## 8\. Be Authentic

Authenticity is key to building rapport with candidates. Be yourself and let your genuine interest and enthusiasm shine through. Avoid using scripted or robotic interview techniques. Candidates appreciate interviewers who are authentic and personable. When you are authentic, candidates are more likely to reciprocate, leading to a more open and comfortable conversation.

## 9\. Follow-Up and Communication

After the interview, maintain regular communication with candidates. Follow up with a personalized email or phone call to express your appreciation for their time and interest in the position. Provide updates on the status of the hiring process, if possible. Engaging in ongoing communication demonstrates your commitment to candidates and strengthens the rapport you have built.

## Conclusion

Building rapport with candidates is a crucial aspect of the interview process. By creating a welcoming atmosphere, actively listening, establishing common ground, using open-ended questions, showing empathy, tailoring your approach, sharing information about the company, being authentic, and maintaining communication, you can foster meaningful connections and conduct more effective interviews. Building rapport allows candidates to feel comfortable and showcase their true abilities, enabling you to make well-informed hiring decisions. By employing these techniques, you can create positive interview experiences and establish rapport that benefits both candidates and your organization.
