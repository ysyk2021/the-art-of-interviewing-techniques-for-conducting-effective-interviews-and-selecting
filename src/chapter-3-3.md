# Developing Interview Questions and Evaluation Criteria

In this chapter, we will delve into the process of developing effective interview questions and establishing evaluation criteria. Crafting well-structured questions and setting clear evaluation criteria are crucial for conducting thorough and unbiased interviews, enabling you to identify the right candidates for the position. By following the strategies outlined in this chapter, you can enhance your interviewing process and make informed hiring decisions.

## Understand the Job Requirements

Before developing interview questions, it is essential to have a comprehensive understanding of the job requirements. Review the job description, including the key responsibilities, required skills, and qualifications. Consult with relevant stakeholders, such as the hiring manager or team members, to gain further insights into the role's expectations and the desired attributes of an ideal candidate. This information will serve as the foundation for creating targeted interview questions.

## Create a Question Bank

Develop a question bank that encompasses a range of topics relevant to the position. Each question should be designed to assess specific skills, experiences, and qualities that are essential for success in the role. Include questions that address technical expertise, problem-solving abilities, collaboration skills, communication proficiency, and other relevant competencies. Having a well-rounded question bank will allow you to select the most appropriate questions for each candidate and facilitate a comprehensive evaluation.

## Use a Mix of Question Types

To gather a comprehensive understanding of a candidate's qualifications and capabilities, incorporate a mix of question types into your interviews. Some common question types include:

1. Behavioral Questions: These questions ask candidates to describe past experiences and how they handled particular situations. For example, "Can you tell me about a time when you faced a challenging deadline and how you managed to meet it?"
    
2. Situational Questions: These questions present hypothetical scenarios that candidates may encounter on the job. They gauge problem-solving and decision-making abilities. For example, "How would you handle a situation where a team member consistently misses deadlines?"
    
3. Technical Questions: These questions assess a candidate's proficiency in specific technical skills required for the role. Tailor these questions to the job requirements. For example, "What programming languages are you proficient in, and how have you used them in previous projects?"
    
4. Cultural Fit Questions: These questions assess a candidate's alignment with the organization's values and work culture. For example, "Can you describe the type of work environment where you thrive the most?"
    

By using a mix of question types, you can gain insights into various aspects of a candidate's qualifications and suitability for the role.

## Develop Behavioral Anchored Rating Scales (BARS)

To ensure objective evaluation of candidates, consider developing Behavioral Anchored Rating Scales (BARS). BARS provide clear performance indicators for each question, enabling interviewers to evaluate responses consistently across candidates. Establish a rating scale that aligns with the desired competencies and behaviors. For instance:

- 4: Exceeds Expectations: The candidate demonstrates exceptional proficiency in the area.
- 3: Meets Expectations: The candidate meets the required competency level.
- 2: Partially Meets Expectations: The candidate possesses some of the necessary skills but needs further development.
- 1: Does Not Meet Expectations: The candidate lacks the required competency level.

Creating BARS helps eliminate biases and subjectivity in the evaluation process, ensuring a fair and consistent assessment of candidates.

## Consider Hypothetical Scenarios

To gauge a candidate's problem-solving abilities and critical thinking skills, incorporate hypothetical scenarios into the interview process. Present candidates with challenging situations they may encounter on the job and ask them to propose potential solutions. Assess their analytical thinking, creativity, and ability to apply their knowledge and experiences to practical situations. Hypothetical scenarios provide valuable insights into a candidate's thought process and aptitude for addressing real-life challenges.

## Align Evaluation Criteria with Job Requirements

When establishing evaluation criteria, ensure they align closely with the job requirements and the organization's goals. Clearly define the key attributes, skills, and experiences that are essential for success in the role. Review the evaluation criteria with the hiring team to ensure a consensus on the desired qualifications. This alignment will help you evaluate candidates more objectively and select those who are the best fit for the position.

## Train Interviewers

To maintain consistency and fairness in the interview process, provide training to interviewers on using the established evaluation criteria and applying BARS effectively. This training will ensure that all interviewers have a clear understanding of the expectations and can evaluate candidates consistently. Address any potential biases or assumptions that may influence the evaluation process, fostering an inclusive and objective selection process.

## Conclusion

Developing effective interview questions and establishing clear evaluation criteria are essential for conducting successful interviews and selecting the right candidates. By understanding the job requirements, creating a question bank, using a mix of question types, and aligning the evaluation criteria with the job requirements, you can conduct thorough and unbiased evaluations. Implementing BARS, considering hypothetical scenarios, and providing training to interviewers further enhance the effectiveness and fairness of the interviewing process. By following these strategies, you will be better equipped to assess candidates accurately and make well-informed hiring decisions.
