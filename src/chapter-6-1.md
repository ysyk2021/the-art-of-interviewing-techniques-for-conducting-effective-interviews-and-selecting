In this chapter, we will explore effective techniques for evaluating the technical and functional skills of candidates during the interview process. Assessing these skills is crucial for ensuring that candidates possess the necessary expertise to perform their roles effectively. By incorporating the following strategies, you can confidently evaluate and select candidates who have the technical and functional competencies required for success in your organization.

## 1\. Clearly Define Technical and Functional Requirements

Before conducting interviews, clearly define the technical and functional skills required for the role. Identify the specific knowledge, abilities, and experience necessary to perform the job effectively. This establishes the foundation for evaluating candidates' proficiency in these areas.

## 2\. Review Resumes and Portfolios

Thoroughly review candidates' resumes and portfolios before the interview. Look for indications of relevant technical and functional skills, such as certifications, previous job experiences, and educational background. This initial screening helps identify candidates who possess the necessary qualifications.

## 3\. Prepare Technical Questions

Develop a set of technical questions tailored to assess the specific skills and knowledge required for the role. These questions should cover both theoretical concepts and practical applications. Consider using real-life scenarios or case studies to evaluate how candidates would approach and solve problems related to the position.

## 4\. Conduct Technical Assessments

Consider incorporating technical assessments into the interview process. These assessments could include coding exercises, problem-solving challenges, or simulations that require candidates to demonstrate their technical and functional skills in a hands-on manner. This practical evaluation provides valuable insights into their abilities.

## 5\. Ask Behavioral Questions

To gauge candidates' practical experience and application of technical and functional skills, ask behavioral questions that require them to share examples from past projects or work experiences. Encourage candidates to describe specific challenges they faced and how they overcame them using their technical expertise. This allows you to assess their problem-solving abilities in real-world contexts.

## 6\. Seek References from Previous Employers

When evaluating technical and functional skills, consider reaching out to candidates' previous employers for references. Contacting former supervisors or colleagues can provide valuable insights into a candidate's abilities, work ethic, and proficiency in specific technical areas. This helps validate the claims made during the interview process.

## 7\. Organize Panel Interviews

Consider organizing panel interviews that involve multiple interviewers with expertise in the required technical and functional areas. Each interviewer can focus on assessing specific skills and ask questions related to their area of expertise. Collaboratively evaluating candidates from different perspectives provides a comprehensive assessment of their capabilities.

## 8\. Simulate Work Scenarios

Simulating work scenarios can be an effective way to evaluate technical and functional skills. Create scenarios that mirror real-life situations candidates may encounter on the job and assess how they respond. This allows you to observe their problem-solving abilities, decision-making processes, and application of technical knowledge in practical settings.

## 9\. Assess Learning and Adaptability

In addition to evaluating current technical and functional skills, consider assessing candidates' learning ability and adaptability. Technology and industry trends are constantly evolving, so it is important to identify candidates who can quickly learn new skills and adapt to changing environments. Ask about their experiences with acquiring new knowledge and their willingness to stay updated in their field.

## 10\. Provide Opportunities for Skill Demonstration

Offer candidates the opportunity to demonstrate their technical and functional skills during the interview. This could be done through presentations, coding exercises, or live demonstrations. Allowing candidates to showcase their capabilities firsthand provides a more accurate assessment of their proficiency.

## Conclusion

Evaluating technical and functional skills is essential for selecting candidates who possess the necessary expertise to excel in their roles. By clearly defining requirements, reviewing resumes and portfolios, preparing technical questions, conducting assessments, asking behavioral questions, seeking references, organizing panel interviews, simulating work scenarios, assessing learning and adaptability, and providing opportunities for skill demonstration, you can effectively assess candidates' technical and functional competencies. Remember to evaluate not only their current skills but also their potential for growth and adaptation. By employing these techniques, you can make informed decisions and select candidates who will contribute to the success of your organization.
