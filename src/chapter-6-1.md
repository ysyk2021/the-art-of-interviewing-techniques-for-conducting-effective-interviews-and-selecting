Evaluating Technical and Functional Skills
==================================================================================================

Assessing candidate skills and competencies, including technical and functional skills, is critical to making informed hiring decisions. In this chapter, we will discuss how to evaluate technical and functional skills during the interview process.

Identifying Technical and Functional Skills
-------------------------------------------

Before evaluating technical and functional skills, recruiters and hiring managers need to identify the key skills required for the role. Technical skills might include proficiency in a particular software program or knowledge of a specific industry. Functional skills might include problem-solving ability, attention to detail, or project management experience. By identifying these key skills, recruiters and hiring managers can tailor their interview questions to evaluate a candidate's ability to perform in the role.

Preparing Technical and Functional Skill-Based Interview Questions
------------------------------------------------------------------

To evaluate technical and functional skills effectively, recruiters and hiring managers need to prepare specific questions that require candidates to provide examples of how they have demonstrated particular technical or functional skills. For example, if a key technical skill for the role is knowledge of a particular programming language, a recruiter might ask a question such as, "Can you provide an example of a project where you had to use this programming language and what challenges you faced?" By asking specific questions that require candidates to provide detailed examples, recruiters and hiring managers can evaluate a candidate's potential more effectively.

Conducting Technical and Functional Skills Assessments
------------------------------------------------------

Technical and functional skills assessments can also be an effective method for evaluating a candidate's abilities. These assessments might involve tasks, tests, or projects related to the skills required for the role. By testing a candidate's abilities in a controlled environment, recruiters and hiring managers can evaluate their potential performance on the job.

Evaluating Technical and Functional Skill Responses
---------------------------------------------------

When evaluating candidate responses related to technical and functional skills, it's essential to assess them based on the key skills required for the role. This might involve assigning scores or using a rubric to evaluate responses against specific criteria. It's important to evaluate responses objectively, based on the requirements of the role, rather than personal biases or preferences.

Conclusion
----------

Assessing candidate technical and functional skills is an essential aspect of the hiring process. By identifying key skills, preparing effective interview questions, conducting skills assessments, and evaluating responses objectively, organizations can make more informed hiring decisions and select the right candidate for the role. Properly assessing technical and functional skills will lead to a more successful hire and ensure the candidate has the necessary qualifications to excel in the role.
