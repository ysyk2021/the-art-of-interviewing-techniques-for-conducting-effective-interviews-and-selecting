Using Behavioral Interviewing to Assess Candidate's Past Performance
===================================================================================================================

Behavioral interviewing is a technique used to assess past performance by asking candidates to provide specific examples of how they have handled situations in the past. This chapter will discuss the benefits of using behavioral interviewing techniques and strategies for conducting effective behavioral interviews.

The Benefits of Behavioral Interviewing
---------------------------------------

Behavioral interviewing has several benefits over traditional interview techniques, including:

* Providing concrete examples of how the candidate has handled past situations, rather than hypothetical responses.
* Allowing interviewers to assess the candidate's skills and experience directly related to the job requirements.
* Reducing the likelihood of biases and discrimination in the hiring process.

Strategies for Conducting Effective Behavioral Interviews
---------------------------------------------------------

To conduct effective behavioral interviews, consider the following strategies:

### Develop Job-Related Behavioral Questions

Develop job-related behavioral questions that are specific to the job requirements and desirable candidate traits. Examples of behavioral interview questions include:

* "Can you tell me about a time when you had to handle a difficult customer?"
* "Describe a project you worked on where you had to demonstrate leadership skills."
* "Tell me about a time when you had to work under pressure to meet a deadline."

### Use the STAR Method to Assess Responses

Use the STAR method to assess the candidate's responses to behavioral interview questions. STAR stands for Situation, Task, Action, and Result. Ask the candidate to describe the situation, task, action they took, and the result of their actions.

### Listen Actively and Ask Follow-Up Questions

Listen actively to the candidate's responses and ask follow-up questions to clarify and gather more information. Encourage the candidate to provide specific details and examples to support their responses.

### Evaluate Answers and Compare to Job Requirements

Evaluate the candidate's answers to the behavioral interview questions and compare them to the job requirements and desirable candidate traits. Assess how well the candidate's past experiences align with the job requirements and how they demonstrated the desired skills and behaviors.

Putting Behavioral Interviewing Techniques into Practice
--------------------------------------------------------

To put behavioral interviewing techniques into practice:

* Develop job-related behavioral interview questions.
* Use the STAR method to assess the candidate's responses.
* Listen actively and ask follow-up questions to clarify and gather more information.
* Evaluate the candidate's answers and compare them to the job requirements.

In conclusion, using behavioral interviewing techniques is an effective way to assess a candidate's past performance and reduce biases in the hiring process. Strategies for conducting effective behavioral interviews include developing job-related behavioral questions, using the STAR method to assess responses, listening actively and asking follow-up questions, and evaluating answers compared to job requirements. By putting these techniques into practice, interviewers can make informed hiring decisions that align with the organization's goals and find the right candidates for the job.
