* Keep the screening interview brief and to the point.

Behavioral Interviews

Behavioral interviews involve asking candidates to describe specific situations in which they demonstrated particular behaviors, skills, and abilities. The following tips can help interviewers conduct effective behavioral interviews:

In conclusion, understanding the different types of interviews and their purposes is critical to conducting effective interviews and selecting the right candidates. By using screening interviews to narrow down the applicant pool, behavioral interviews to evaluate past behavior, technical interviews to assess necessary skills, group interviews to assess collaboration and communication, and panel interviews to evaluate fit with the organization, interviewers can employ the most appropriate format for each stage of the hiring process.
