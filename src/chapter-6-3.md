In this chapter, we will explore the concept of competency-based interviewing and how it can be effectively used to evaluate the potential of candidates during the interview process. Competency-based interviewing is a structured approach that focuses on assessing a candidate's specific skills, behaviors, and attributes required for success in a particular role. By utilizing this technique, you can gain valuable insights into a candidate's capabilities and make informed decisions when selecting the right candidates for your organization.

## 1\. Understanding Competencies

Before delving into competency-based interviewing, it is essential to have a clear understanding of competencies. Competencies are the combination of knowledge, skills, behaviors, and attributes that contribute to successful job performance. They can include both technical skills and soft skills such as problem-solving, communication, leadership, adaptability, and teamwork.

## 2\. Identifying Key Competencies

To conduct effective competency-based interviews, it is crucial to identify the key competencies required for the role. Analyze the job description and consult with relevant stakeholders to determine the critical skills and behaviors that are essential for success in the position. These key competencies will form the basis of the interview questions and evaluation criteria.

## 3\. Developing Competency-Based Questions

Competency-based interview questions are designed to elicit specific examples from candidates that demonstrate their competency in a particular area. These questions typically begin with phrases like "Tell me about a time when..." or "Give me an example of...". Develop a set of questions for each identified competency, ensuring that they are open-ended and allow candidates to provide detailed responses.

## 4\. Structuring the Interview

When conducting competency-based interviews, it is crucial to follow a structured format. Start by introducing the interview and explaining the competency-based approach. Ask the pre-determined competency-based questions, allowing candidates to provide detailed examples. Follow-up with probing questions to gain further insights and clarification. Take thorough notes during the interview to aid in evaluation and comparison.

## 5\. Active Listening and Observation

During the competency-based interview, actively listen to candidates' responses and observe their behaviors. Pay attention to the specific details they provide, the clarity of their explanations, and the way they articulate their thoughts. Look for evidence of the desired competencies in their examples and assess their ability to apply these competencies to real-life situations.

## 6\. Using Behavioral Indicators

To assess candidates' competencies objectively, develop a set of behavioral indicators or scoring criteria for each competency. These indicators can help you evaluate the extent to which a candidate demonstrates a particular skill or behavior. Use a rating scale to assess candidates consistently, enabling fair comparisons between different candidates.

## 7\. Probing for Depth and Specifics

When evaluating candidates' responses, don't hesitate to probe for more depth and specifics. Ask follow-up questions to understand the context, the candidate's role, the actions they took, and the outcomes of their actions. This allows you to gain a comprehensive understanding of their competency level and determine if they possess the skills and behaviors required for the role.

## 8\. Evaluating and Comparing Candidates

After conducting competency-based interviews, evaluate candidates based on their responses, observed behaviors, and the established scoring criteria. Compare candidates' performance against each competency, considering the quality and relevance of their examples, and their overall fit for the role. Be mindful of any biases and ensure fairness throughout the evaluation process.

## 9\. Assessing Development Potential

Competency-based interviewing not only helps evaluate a candidate's current abilities but also provides insights into their development potential. Consider how well candidates demonstrate the desired competencies and assess their capacity for growth and adaptation. Identifying candidates with high development potential can be valuable for positions that require continuous learning and advancement.

## 10\. Providing Constructive Feedback

After completing competency-based interviews, provide candidates with constructive feedback. Discuss their performance, highlighting areas of strength and areas for improvement. Offer specific examples from the interview to support your feedback. This not only helps candidates understand their competencies but also provides them with an opportunity for growth and development.

## Conclusion

Competency-based interviewing is a valuable technique for evaluating the potential of candidates during the interview process. By identifying key competencies, developing appropriate interview questions, structuring the interview, actively listening and observing, using behavioral indicators, probing for depth and specifics, evaluating and comparing candidates, assessing development potential, and providing constructive feedback, you can effectively assess a candidate's suitability for a role. Competency-based interviewing enables you to select candidates who not only possess the required skills and behaviors but also have the potential to thrive and contribute to your organization's success.
