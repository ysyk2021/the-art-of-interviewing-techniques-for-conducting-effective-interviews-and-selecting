In this chapter, we will explore strategies and techniques for asking probing questions that help interviewers conduct effective interviews and elicit detailed responses from candidates. Mastering the art of asking probing questions is crucial for gaining deeper insights into a candidate's qualifications, skills, experience, and fit for the position. By incorporating these strategies into your interviewing process, you can enhance your ability to assess candidates and make informed hiring decisions.

## Prepare Thoughtful and Relevant Questions

Before the interview, take the time to thoroughly review the candidate's application materials, including their resume, cover letter, and any additional documents they may have submitted. Based on this information, identify areas that require further clarification or examples of their skills and experiences. Prepare thoughtful and relevant probing questions that delve into these areas, allowing you to gather detailed information during the interview.

## Start with Open-Ended Questions

Begin the interview with open-ended questions that encourage candidates to provide detailed responses. Open-ended questions cannot be answered with a simple "yes" or "no" but require candidates to elaborate and provide specific examples. For example, instead of asking, "Do you have experience in project management?", ask, "Can you describe a project you managed from start to finish? What challenges did you face, and how did you overcome them?" This approach invites candidates to share detailed information about their experiences and qualifications.

## Use Follow-Up Questions

When a candidate provides a response, follow up with additional questions to probe deeper into the topic. These follow-up questions should seek clarification, examples, and further details to gain a comprehensive understanding of the candidate's capabilities. For instance, if a candidate mentions a specific accomplishment, you could ask, "Can you explain how you achieved that result? What specific strategies or actions did you take?" By using follow-up questions, you encourage candidates to provide more in-depth information, enabling you to make a more accurate assessment.

## Employ the STAR Method

The Situation, Task, Action, Result (STAR) method is an effective framework for asking probing questions about a candidate's past experiences. Use this method to structure your questions and guide candidates in providing detailed responses. Start by asking about the Situation or Task they faced, then inquire about the specific Actions they took, and conclude by asking for the Results they achieved. This method encourages candidates to provide a comprehensive account of their experiences, showcasing their skills and abilities.

## Practice Active Listening

Active listening is crucial when asking probing questions. Give candidates your full attention, maintain eye contact, and demonstrate genuine interest in their responses. Take notes to capture key points and ask follow-up questions based on their answers. By practicing active listening, you create a comfortable environment that encourages candidates to share detailed information and insights.

## Be Comfortable with Silence

When a candidate finishes responding to a question, avoid rushing to fill the silence. Sometimes, candidates need a moment to gather their thoughts and provide more information. Embrace brief periods of silence, as they can prompt candidates to elaborate further on their responses, offering valuable insights. By being comfortable with silence, you give candidates the necessary space to provide detailed and well-thought-out responses.

## Avoid Leading Questions

To elicit detailed and unbiased responses, avoid asking leading questions that steer candidates towards certain answers. Leading questions often contain assumptions or suggest a preferred response. Instead, focus on neutral and objective questions that allow candidates to share their genuine experiences and perspectives. This approach ensures that you receive accurate and authentic information during the interview process.

## Build Rapport and Establish Trust

Establishing rapport and trust with candidates is essential for encouraging detailed and honest responses. Create a welcoming and friendly atmosphere by starting the interview with small talk and putting candidates at ease. Show empathy and understanding, and maintain a professional yet approachable demeanor throughout the interview. When candidates feel comfortable and trusted, they are more likely to provide detailed and insightful responses.

## Encourage Candidates to Ask Questions

At the end of the interview, provide candidates with an opportunity to ask their questions. Their inquiries can provide further insights into their understanding of the role and organization and their level of engagement. Pay attention to the questions candidates ask, as they can demonstrate their curiosity, critical thinking, and preparedness. Encouraging candidates to ask questions allows you to gauge their interest in the position and assess their fit for the organization more comprehensively.

## Conclusion

Mastering the art of asking probing questions is a valuable skill for interviewers. By following these strategies, you can conduct more effective interviews and elicit detailed responses from candidates. Thoughtful preparation, open-ended questions, active listening, and building rapport are all key elements to ensure a successful interview process. By incorporating these techniques into your interviewing approach, you will gain deeper insights into candidates' qualifications, skills, and experiences, leading to more informed hiring decisions.
